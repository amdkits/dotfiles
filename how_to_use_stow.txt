first of all
install stow and yada yada all that

to push files in github
1. mv the dir to the appropriate file system or rename it to <name>.bak 
and copy original folder to dotfile and such folder
e.g. ~/.config/nvim will move to ~/dotfiles/.config/nvim
move such that the file tree will be same
2. stow .
3. git add . {incase something doesn't gets added, 
    check if that filesystem has .git in it
        this happened with me now since nvim wouldn't get added as it had .git in it}
4. git push origin main
        IDK what happens but all files will be copied to the folder
{e.g. dotfiles in this case}try finding some remedy
